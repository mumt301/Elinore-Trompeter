        <p>My name is Elinore Trompeter and I am a third year Arts student at McGill! I major in Sociology and double minor in Social Entrepreneurship and Music Tech. Most of my free time is spent listening to music, singing, playing CoD, making food, and hanging out with friends. It would be impossible for me to pick a favorite music genre, but a few are RnB, Pop Rap, Gospel, House, and Hip Hop. I'm also not very good at coding!</p>
